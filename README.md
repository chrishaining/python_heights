# Python heights

The purpose of this project is to practise using multiple classes in Python, including inheritance. I'm also hoping to include some statistical practice with averages.


## The scenario

There is a population of people, divided into males and females. The females can reproduce, creating a new generation of people. Each person has a height, and this height is influenced by:
  1. consistent factors that affect the entire population, such as improved healthcare, nutrition and sanitation
  2. inheritance from their parents: parents who are taller than average will most likely have children who are taller than average.
  3. random events (luck), which do not affect each member of the population evenly.

This means that:
  1. each new generation should have a consistent trend, for instance the average height increases.
  2. any given individual may be closer or further away from the average than their parents were.
